# HTML-Project-for-Exploring-Computer-Science
This is a project I did in my Exploring Computer Science Class.

I had put 5 pages for the project. 

1. There are two pages that do not work.
  
	a. One of the pages had a trial page. That is labeled as trialpage2.html. This page had an extremely cool search feature. It allowed you to search for a 
     name of a car brands, drivetrain types, exterior color, and interior color. 
  
	b. The second page was not completed.

2. The other 3 pages work fine.

# I also want to give credits to Dynamic Drive for some of the features like the navigation bar and a scroller
